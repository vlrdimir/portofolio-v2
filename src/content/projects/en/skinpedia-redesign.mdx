## What I Built

Redesigned an old, outdated website into a modern, responsive platform for my final university project. The goal was simple: make it look good, work fast, and be easy to use on any device.

## Key Improvements

- **Modern design** - Clean, intuitive interface that follows current web standards
- **Mobile-first** - Fully responsive design that works perfectly on phones and tablets
- **Better performance** - Faster loading times and smoother interactions
- **Improved navigation** - Simplified structure that makes sense to users
- **Accessibility** - Better support for all users, including those with disabilities

## Tech Stack

Built with **Next.js** and modern CSS frameworks. Focused on creating reusable components and a maintainable codebase. Used best practices for SEO and performance optimization.
