- Saves files using the date-based filename format `YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx`

## How to Use

1. Download `idxdaily.rar` and extract it
2. Configure the `config.toml`

```toml
[base]
# Path to Chrome.exe
chrome_dir = "C:/Program Files/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe"

# Output folder for downloaded files
output_dir = "C:/Users/your_name/Downloads/output/"
```

3. Double-click the `.exe` to launch the app
4. Use the **"Launch Chrome"** option to start a browser session
5. Choose a start and end date when prompted
6. Review the confirmation table for date range and total workdays
7. Confirm to start the download
8. The resulting Excel files will be saved to your configured `output_dir`

> **Note:**
> Make sure `app.py` and `config.toml` are in the same folder so the app can read your configuration.
