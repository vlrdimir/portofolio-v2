![Flowers Classification System](/img/project/kecerdasan-buatan.png)

Created an AI-powered flower classification app for my final AI project. Upload a flower photo, and it instantly tells you what species it is. The ML model is custom-trained and deployed on Hugging Face, showing I can build complete AI applications from scratch.

## Key Features

- **Real-time classification** - Upload a flower image and get instant species identification
- **Confidence scores** - See how confident the AI is about each prediction
- **Clean interface** - Modern, responsive design built with Next.js 15
- **Fast predictions** - Quick response times thanks to optimized ML pipeline
- **Educational content** - Learn about different flower species

## Tech Stack

Built with **Next.js 15**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The ML model is hosted on **Hugging Face** and integrated via Gradio client. Used React Query for efficient data fetching and React Hook Form with Zod validation.
