![IoT Temperature Monitoring Dashboard](/img/project/iot.png)

Won **1st place** in an IoT Bootcamp competition with this real-time temperature and humidity monitoring system. The app connects to IoT sensors via MQTT protocol and displays live data with charts. Features an AI assistant (like Alexa or Home Assistant) that lets you control IoT devices through voice commands and MQTT messages.

## Key Features

- **Real-time monitoring** - Live temperature and humidity readings from sensors
- **MQTT integration** - Seamless connection to sensor data streams
- **Interactive charts** - Visualize historical and real-time trends
- **AI assistant** - Voice-controlled assistant to control IoT devices through MQTT commands
- **Data storage** - Save and retrieve historical sensor data

## Tech Stack

Built with **Next.js 15**, **TypeScript**, and **MQTT** for real-time communication. Used **Zustand** for state management and **Drizzle ORM** with Turso SQLite to store historical data. The AI assistant integrates with Azure OpenAI to process voice commands and send MQTT control messages to IoT devices.
